# Zendeath

An open source command-line client for Zendesk.

Primarly created as a learning experience.

Current commands include:

  * me - Shows what Zendesk knows about the current user.
  * localinfo - shows config data.
  * alltickets - Shows total number of tickets, plus number of unsolved
ticekts.

Currently has no external dependencies for real functionality, but
requires pry because reasons.

No tests because I don't know how to write tests yet.
